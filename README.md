Excel file for tracking and documenting PD hours for professional designations
This simple file allows professionals who have PD hours requirements to track and document their accumulated hours
The objective of this file is to provide professional with a place to store all of the information that may be required to submit to their oversight body at a reporting period or in the event of an audit
The lead sheet has a table to track all related hours in which each row is hyperlinked to a supporting documentation worksheet in the file
The hyperlinks are in the key column
Each supporting documentation worksheet is hyperlinked back to the lead sheet for ease of navigation
Each supporting documentation worksheet is customizable but uses the INDEX formula to dynamically create a title based on each tabular row
The 'REQ' tab is a blank space to embed any text, images, or links that a user may need to reference such as annual or semi-annual hours requirements
